### 3. Assumptions & Risks

- **Assumptions:**
  - A single developer will be working on the project.

  - The Lilo & Stitch assets (images, fonts, sounds) will be available or created as needed.

  - The Firebase free/spark plan will be sufficient for the initial launch and usage.

- **Risks:**
  - **Scope Creep:** Additional feature requests during development could impact the timeline. (Mitigation: Adhere strictly to the SRS, with a clear change control process).

  - **Content Bottleneck:** The creation of 50 high-quality puzzles may take longer than anticipated. (Mitigation: Begin content creation early and in parallel with development).

  - **Technical Challenges:** Unforeseen issues with Firebase integration or complex UI states. (Mitigation: Allocate buffer time in the schedule and prioritize core functionality).
