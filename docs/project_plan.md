## 4. Key Architectural Decisions

- **Decision (YYYY-MM-DD)**: We chose FastAPI over Django for the backend.
  - **Rationale**: FastAPI's performance, automatic validation with Pydantic, and async support are better suited for a modern API-first architecture.
- **Decision (YYYY-MM-DD)**: We are using the Repository Pattern for data access.
  - **Rationale**: To decouple business logic from data persistence, improving testability and maintainability.
