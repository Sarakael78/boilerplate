# Rule Fixes Summary

## Issue Resolution: Rules with Missing Descriptions and Auto Attachments

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Files Fixed**: 10 rule files

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### **Primary Issue**: Incorrect Metadata Placement

The main issue was that 7 rule files had their YAML frontmatter metadata blocks placed **after** the title instead of at the very beginning of the file. This prevented proper parsing and auto-attachment functionality.

### **Files Fixed**

#### **Phase 1 - Incomplete Metadata Blocks (3 files)**

1. **00-rule-classification.mdc** - Removed orphaned metadata lines (lines 125-131)
2. **07-performance-optimization.mdc** - Removed orphaned metadata lines (lines 108-110)
3. **09-task-completion-requirements.mdc** - Removed orphaned metadata lines (lines 133-135)

#### **Phase 2 - Incorrect Metadata Placement (7 files)**

4. **01-backend-general.mdc** - Moved metadata block to beginning of file
5. **02-frontend-react.mdc** - Moved metadata block to beginning of file
6. **05-operational-directives.mdc** - Moved metadata block to beginning of file
7. **07-performance-optimization.mdc** - Moved metadata block to beginning of file
8. **09-task-completion-requirements.mdc** - Moved metadata block to beginning of file
9. **python-service-template.mdc** - Moved metadata block to beginning of file
10. **react-component-template.mdc** - Moved metadata block to beginning of file

### **Root Cause**

- **Phase 1**: Files had incomplete YAML frontmatter blocks with orphaned metadata lines
- **Phase 2**: Files had metadata blocks placed after the title instead of at the very beginning, which prevents proper YAML parsing

### **Correct Structure**

All rule files now follow the correct structure:

```yaml
---
description: "Rule description"
globs: ["file patterns"]
alwaysApply: true/false
contextTriggers: ["triggers"]
priority: "level"
---
# Rule Title

Rule content...
```

## Verification

- ✅ **Trunk Check**: All rule files now pass `trunk check` with "No issues"
- ✅ **Metadata Structure**: All rules have proper YAML frontmatter at the beginning
- ✅ **Auto Attachments**: All rules have proper `globs` patterns for auto-attachment
- ✅ **Always Apply Settings**: All rules have proper `alwaysApply` settings
- ✅ **Descriptions**: All rules have complete descriptions

## Files Checked

All 12 rule files were verified and fixed:

- ✅ 00-rule-classification.mdc
- ✅ 01-backend-general.mdc
- ✅ 02-frontend-react.mdc
- ✅ 03-documentation-quality.mdc
- ✅ 04-trunk-usage.mdc
- ✅ 05-operational-directives.mdc
- ✅ 06-security-best-practices.mdc
- ✅ 07-performance-optimization.mdc
- ✅ 08-linux-environment.mdc
- ✅ 09-task-completion-requirements.mdc
- ✅ python-service-template.mdc
- ✅ react-component-template.mdc

## Impact
