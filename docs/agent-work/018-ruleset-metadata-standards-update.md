# Ruleset Metadata Standards Update

## Issue Resolution: Rule File Metadata Standards

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Files Updated**: 3 rule files + 1 new rule file

## Updates Made

### **1. Enhanced Documentation Quality Rule (03-documentation-quality.mdc)**

Added comprehensive rule file metadata standards:

- **Rule File Metadata Standards**: Detailed requirements for YAML frontmatter structure
- **Required Fields**: description, globs, alwaysApply, contextTriggers, priority
- **CRITICAL Placement Rule**: Metadata must be at the very beginning of files
- **Validation Requirements**: Clear examples and common mistakes to avoid

### **2. New Rule File Standards (11-rule-file-standards.mdc)**

Created dedicated rule for rule file creation and modification:

- **YAML Frontmatter Structure**: Exact template for metadata blocks
- **Metadata Field Requirements**: Detailed specifications for each field
- **CRITICAL PLACEMENT RULE**: Metadata must be at the very beginning
- **Common Mistakes**: Clear examples of what to avoid
- **Validation Checklist**: Step-by-step verification process
- **Rule File Naming Convention**: Proper naming and numbering standards
- **Rule Classification**: How to organize rules in classification file

### **3. Updated Rule Classification (00-rule-classification.mdc)**

Added new rules to the classification system:

- **Agent Operational Protocol (10-agent-operational-protocol.mdc)**: Critical operational standards
- **Rule File Standards (11-rule-file-standards.mdc)**: Critical metadata requirements
- **Updated Decision Matrix**: Includes new rules in the table
- **Always Apply Rules**: Both new rules marked as always apply

## Metadata Structure Requirements

### **Required YAML Frontmatter**

```yaml
---
description: "Clear description of what the rule does and when to apply it"
globs: ["file patterns for auto-attachment"]
alwaysApply: true/false
contextTriggers: ["trigger keywords"]
priority: "critical|high|medium|low"
---
```

### **Field Specifications**

- **description**: Clear description of rule purpose and application
- **globs**: File patterns for auto-attachment
- **alwaysApply**: true for critical rules, false for context-specific rules
- **contextTriggers**: Keywords for intelligent application
- **priority**: critical, high, medium, or low

### **CRITICAL Requirements**

- **Placement**: Metadata MUST be at the very beginning of the file
- **No Content Before**: No titles, text, or content before metadata block
- **Complete Structure**: All required fields must be present
- **Proper YAML**: Correct syntax and indentation
- **No Incomplete Blocks**: No orphaned metadata at end of files

## Validation Process

### **Before Creating/Modifying Rule Files**

1. **Metadata Placement**: Verify metadata is at the very beginning
2. **Required Fields**: Check all required fields are present
3. **YAML Syntax**: Ensure proper YAML formatting
4. **No Orphaned Metadata**: Check for incomplete blocks elsewhere
5. **Trunk Check**: Run `trunk check` to validate

### **Common Mistakes Prevented**

- ❌ Metadata after title or content
- ❌ Incomplete metadata blocks at end of file
- ❌ Missing required fields
- ❌ Incorrect YAML syntax
- ❌ Wrong placement of metadata block

## Impact

- ✅ **Prevents Metadata Errors**: Clear standards prevent common mistakes
- ✅ **Ensures Rule Functionality**: Proper metadata ensures rules work correctly
- ✅ **Auto-Attachment**: Rules will properly auto-attach to relevant files
- ✅ **Consistency**: All rule files follow the same structure
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clear standards make rules easier to maintain
