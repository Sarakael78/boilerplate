- **Documentation Organization**: All documentation files (except README.md) must be placed in the `/docs` folder. This includes:
  - API documentation
  - Architectural decisions (ADRs)
  - Setup guides
  - Development guidelines
  - Deployment instructions
  - Troubleshooting guides
  - Any other project documentation

- **README.md Location**: The main README.md file should remain in the project root directory.

- **Code Quality Standards**: Before completing any task or telling the user you are complete:
  1. Run `trunk check` to identify all linting issues
  2. Run `trunk fmt` to automatically format code
  3. Fix any remaining linting errors manually
  4. Ensure all code passes all quality checks
  5. Never leave linting errors in the codebase

- **Documentation Quality**: All documentation must be:
  - Clear and concise
  - Up-to-date with the current codebase
  - Written in proper markdown format
  - Include examples where appropriate
  - Follow consistent formatting standards

- **Code Comments**: All code must have:
  - Clear docstrings for functions and classes
  - Inline comments for complex logic
  - Type hints for all functions and variables
  - Proper error handling documentation
