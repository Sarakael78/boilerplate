- **CRITICAL COMPLETION REQUIREMENT**: Before marking any task as complete, you MUST ensure all trunk linting issues are resolved. This is non-negotiable.

- **Persistence**: Work through the entire task list sequentially. Do not stop or give up. If an obstacle is encountered, attempt self-correction and proceed.

- **Autonomy**: Make all architectural, design, and implementation decisions required to achieve the mission objectives. Any ambiguities in the provided context are to be resolved by applying industry best practices.

- **Decision-Making Framework**:
  - **Backend**: Assume a microservices-friendly, asynchronous Python stack. Prefer asyncio and modern async patterns.
  - **Frontend**: Prioritize a modular, component-based architecture. Use utility-first CSS framework for efficient, responsive styling.
  - **Reporting**: Provide complete, functional code files upon task completion.
  - **Python Dependencies**: Use Poetry exclusively for Python dependency management. Never use pip, conda, or other package managers.

- **Professional Standards & Quality Control**:
  - **Version Control**: Logical grouping of changes; all changes must be atomic.
  - **Code Integrity**: All code must be robust, secure, and production-ready.
  - **Testing**: Implement basic sanity checks and unit tests for critical functionality to prevent regressions.
  - **Documentation**: All new code and architectural decisions must be self-documenting.
  - **Dependency Management**: Use Poetry for all Python dependencies with proper groups and lock files.

- **Task Completion Requirements**:
  - **Comprehensive Fixes**: Address all critical bugs and issues completely
  - **Functional Code**: Ensure all code is fully functional and production-ready
  - **Clean Architecture**: Maintain clean, modern, and maintainable code structure
  - **Complete Delivery**: Provide all necessary code files for a self-contained application
  - **No Placeholders**: Never leave TODO comments, placeholder functions, or incomplete implementations
  - **No Dead Code**: Remove all unused code, imports, and non-functional components
  - **Full Implementation**: Every feature must be fully implemented and functional

- **Security & Performance Standards**:
  - **Security First**: Implement proper authentication, authorization, input validation, and data sanitization
  - **Performance Optimization**: Ensure minimal response times, efficient database queries, and optimized frontend loading
  - **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages without exposing sensitive information
  - **Logging & Monitoring**: Implement structured logging and monitoring for debugging and observability

- **Modern Development Practices**:
  - **API Design**: Follow RESTful principles with consistent naming conventions
  - **State Management**: Use appropriate state management patterns (Zustand for client state, React Query for server state)
  - **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript and Python type checking
  - **Testing Strategy**: Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests as appropriate
  - **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure all changes work with the existing CI/CD pipeline

- **Scalability Considerations**:
  - **Database Design**: Use proper indexing, normalization, and query optimization
  - **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching layers (Redis, CDN, browser caching)
  - **Microservices Ready**: Design components that can be easily extracted into separate services
  - **Async Processing**: Use background tasks for long-running operations
